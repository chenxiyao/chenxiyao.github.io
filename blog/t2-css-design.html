    <p class="first">
      When we write html and css files, sometimes we want to select element in html and change them in css file. At this time, classes and ids can help us.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you want to write a paragraph like "My favourite fruit is apple. Apple is very sweet and healthy." We see the paragraph is blue but the word "apple" I want red color. Here in html file can be: 
      <p>My favourite fruit is <span class="red">apple</span>. Apple is very sweet and healthy.</p>
      or <p>My favourite fruit is <span id="red">apple</span>. Apple is very sweet and healthy.</p>
      And css file for the class one can be:
      p{color:blue;}
      .red{color:red;}
      or the css file for the id one:
      p{color:blue;}
      #red{color:red;}
    </p>
    <p class="second">
      Now we know how to use class and id in html and css, but we may confuse the difference between them. To use ids, we can only use one time, but for classes, we can use many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, also the paragraph "My favourite fruit is apple. Apple is very sweet and healthy." We can see this time, the paragraph is navy but the two words "sweet" and "healthy" are green. Then how do we use classes and ids to implement it?
      Using classes:
      in html is <p>My favourite fruit is apple. Apple is very <span class="green">sweet</span> and <span class="green">healthy</span>.</p>
      and in css is 
      p{color:navy;}
      .green{color:green;}
      It's obvious that the same named class can be used in different places. But ids are different.
      Using ids:
      in html is <p>My favourite fruit is apple. Apple is very <span id="green">sweet</span> and <span id="green-2">healthy</span>.</p>
      and in css is 
      p{color:navy;}
      #green{color:green;}
      #green-2{color:green;}
    </p>
    <p class="third">
        It's better for use to do more practices to understand deeper how to use classes and ids and the differences between them. Create sites to try and we can get it easily!
