      What are the benefits of version control? Version control is very useful and helpful for computer developer. Many developers can work with one project more effective within it. And it can help to record changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

        How does git help you keep track of changes? We can clone the web in local computer and do any changes. Then we git add, git commit, git push to keep the track of changes. This is awesome because it allows many people to do some changes at the same time.

        Why use GitHub to store your code? We use Git just in local computer, but GitHub helps to store anything online. What we changed using Git will be pushed to GitHub online so that online information will be changed.
