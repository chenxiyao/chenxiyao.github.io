  <h1>Class Methods</h1>
  <hr>
  <section>
    <p class="first">
      Now, let's learn something new in Ruby. We know we can use method to define something. However, when we have many method to use together with a total thing. We can use <strong>class</strong> to implement it.
    </p>
    <h4>A simple example</h4>
    <p class="second">
       There's a simple example about die. We want to code how many sides for the die and what's the value for a roll:
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t6.1.JPG" /> <br>
       die.sides will return 6 <br>
       die.roll will return a random number from 1 to 6 
    </p>
    <h3>Some important</h3>
    <p class="fourth">
      Now we know some basic knowledge about class. Here we need to know some important definitions. <br>
      The first is variables. There are four different kinds of variables: local variables, instance variables, class variables, and global variables. <br>
      <br>
      Local Variables: Local variables are defined in a method. That means local variables are not available out of the method. Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _. <br>
      <br>
      Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across all methods in a class. Instance variables begin with (@). <br>
      <br>
      Class Variables: Class variables make a variable accessible to ALL instances of the class. Class variables begin with @@. <br>
      <br>
      Global Variables:Global variable is available across classes. The global variables start with ($).
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      Another important part is the initialize method. Like in the example, at the beginning of a class, we always write the initialize method to initialize the variables. <br>
  
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      Class is a hard part to learn. I believe we need to more practice to be familiar with class first. And then we can learn some more use with class.
