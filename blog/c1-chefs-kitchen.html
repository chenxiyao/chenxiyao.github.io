       DBC is the place to teach computer programs, and also a place to change our life and improve our life.

        As an international student who will graduate soon. It's very helpful to give the environment to work with others. I hope I can be better to communicate with others and work together with people!

        DBC will use some 9 weeks + 9 weeks to let us learn all basic things for being as a computer develop. So of course, it will be very busy. And the environment will let me feel nervous. I mean not the real environment, but you know the pressure and much work. Actually I'm some nervous. But I have confidence and I am very happy that I can change and improve my skills and my life!
