      Let's talk about class. 
    </p>
    <h4>when, why, and how to use classes</h4>
    <p class="second">
       The general structure to use class is:
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t5.1.JPG" /> <br>
       Then we call class_name=ClassName.new for this class and class_name.method_name for the method in the class<br>
       To use class, we always use initialize method at the beginning of the class to initialize variables.
    </p>
    <h4>how data structures and classes can model a real-world object</h4>
    <p class="fourth">
      For the real-world object, first of all, call the object with class.new, then let the object do whatever we want. Therefore, there's whole class and some methods in it.<br>
      For example, the real-world object "die". There's six sides, and we want to see the value or we can say the side after roll one time.<br>
      Therefore, the code can be: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t6.1.JPG" /> 
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      We can also use class to model other real-worlds object like to check if a number is a credit card num, to find out a student's grade, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      Class is very important part in Ruby and can implement many things.
