    <p class="first">
      Nowadays, how to use solar energy economically and effectively becomes a big tech problem people face. The solar energy is only about 1% of the total energy used in the world. However, solar energy has a large capacity. The sun can give our earth very huge energy, we can get much more energy to use if we can exploit the solar energy.
    </p>
    <p class="second">
       So how to use solar energy more economically? I believe we can find out a new material that can be used to produce solar battery so that the cost can be reduced.
    </p>

    <p class="second">
      In addition, the way to expliot solar energy more effectively can be that people create a new technique to increase the use percentage of solar battery.

    <p class="fourth">
      Many people are working on this tech issue: how to use solar energy more economically and effectively. Some of them have some achivements, but it's not enough. We need to work better and better until we feel it's not an issue.
