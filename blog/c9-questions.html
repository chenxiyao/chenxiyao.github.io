      I believe all of us will have the time to ask questions no matther ask online, especailly ask google, ask friends, or ask by other ways. However, some of our questions will not be given answers. Why? Here, let's talk about one of the reasons - not asking good questions. So we need to learn to ask good questions so that we can get more answers for our questions.

      Before posting the quesiton, read it again. Always, we will find some mistakes to correct or make the question clearer.
    <p class="fifth">
      After posting the question, response to feedback is also important. Try to pay attention on these points when you ask questions in the future. Hope you can ask good questions!
