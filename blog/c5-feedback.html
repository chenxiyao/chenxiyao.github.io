      Pairing with others to solve challenges are very useful and helpful. When I didn't know some part or cannot figure out, my partner may know this. Then my partner can teach me. So this make 1+1 and sometimes even >2. You see, it's great. And the error we made in pairing is easy to be found by partners. At the same time, the error is easy to be remembered. However, sometimes, I feel difficult to pair when I know nothing about this challenge.

       After pairing, writing feedback is necessary. And reading the feedback that partners wrote for me is a happy time :) I can learn something that I can improve, and I can find some place that I am really good but I didn't realize :) And partner's feedback are always very kind and sweet!

      We know that it's always very hard to do anything the first time. After it, the more times, easier and better. I think that's because we will get feedback from partners and can improve from it. I really do like this.

      After pairing, the first thing is to write the feedback. However, because I am not good at writing, I always spend much time only on some paragraphs. However, writing feedback is a good thing. My feedback can let my partner know what I think about this pairing. And during the time I wrote the feedback, I also thinking about what I did during the pairing.

      Before DBC learning, I am not always writing feedback and reading feedback. I find the feedback is very helpful and useful and always very kind!
