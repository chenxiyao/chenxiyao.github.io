  <h1>Enumerable#cycle</h1>

    <p class="first">
      In Ruby, there are several methods as Enumerator. Today, let's talk about cycle. I hope we can know what the method cycle is, why we use it, and how we use it.
    </p>
    <h4>What and Why</h4>
    <p class="second">
       The method "cycle" in ruby is a kind of enumerator. Sometimes, we want to repeat something (strings or numbers) several times or even forever. At this time, we can use the cycle method to implement it.
    </p>
    <h3>How</h3>
    <p class="fourth">
      There are two basic ways to use the cycle method. One time is when we want to repeat something many times until forever. Then we code like this:
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t4.1.JPG" />
      <br>
      For example, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t4.2.JPG" />
      <br>
      The result is: 1,2,3,1,2,3...forever
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      The other time that we will use the cycle is when we want ot repeat something for several times. They we will code .cycle(num). <br>
      For example, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t4.3.JPG" />
      <br>
      The result is: 1,2,3,1,2,3
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      Now, I think we know about the cycle method in Ruby as enumerator. What about having a try by ourselves to understand better?
