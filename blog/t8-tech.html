      Web Security is to protect website from attacking, changing content in web. People who didn't work with the web security will not pay attention on the security issue a web has or not. However, for most time, web security issue exists and web security is important and necessary to protect the web.
    </p>
    <h3>Basic Web Security Issues</h3>
    <p class="second">
       1. For most web design, developer only consider the basic customers without thinking more about webpage holes.<br>
       2. The web security is too behind so that it didn't work.<br>
       3. Hacker attacked web and changed web but web cannot find it.<br>
       4. Although we realize the issue, we cannot solve it.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Security Testing</h3>
    <p class="fourth">
      1. Scan the webpage holes<br>
      2. Web Trojan test<br>
      3. Web environment test<br>
      4. Other tests
    </p>
    <h3>Security Measurement</h3>
    <p class="fifth">
      1. Login page encrypted<br>
      2. Connet safe wifi<br>
      3. Not share login information<br>
      4. Protect web using firewall
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      I believe most of us will meet the web security issues. At that time, we need some help for solving that problem. It waste time and money. Therefore, we need to know web security is a important topic and we'd better to know some basic knowledge about it.
