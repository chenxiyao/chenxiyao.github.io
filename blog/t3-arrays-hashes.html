  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <hr>
  <section>
    <p class="first">
      This time, let's think learn something about Ruby. When we want to run some single thing, we can code directly like age=25 in Ruby. However, if we want to run the whole class's students' ages. Or we want to code a person's all information like first name, last name, age. At this time, we need to use arrays and hashes. However, arrays and hashes are different, they have different use and be used in different place
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p class="second">
       Using arrays, we can express many same things in one time. For examples, there are five people in one group, I want to show their ages. So it can be<br>
       age1=10<br>
       age2=11<br>
       age3=12<br>
       age4=13<br>
       age5=14<br>
       But we can express them easier like<br>
       age=[10,11,12,13,14] <br>
       then at this time, age1=age[0]
    </p>
    <p class="second">
      There are many methods using in arrays. age.push(15) means add the element 15 at the end of array age. And there are many other methods that can help to solve some problems much more easily.
    </p>
    <h3>Hashes</h3>
    <p class="third">
      Hash also can express different things in one time, but it's different from arrays. For example, we also want ot show the five people's age. <br>
      Then using hash:<br>
      age = {<br>
        age1 => 10,<br>
        age2 => 11,<br>
        age3 => 12,<br>
        age4 => 13,<br>
        age5 => 14<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p class="third">
      We can also code hash like this age[age1]=[10]
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      As the beginner, we first need to know when to use arrays and hases and the basic use of them. Then the important part that sometimes they are similar but we need to know they are different.
