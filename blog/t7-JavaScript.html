  <h1>Difference between Ruby and JavaScript</h1>

    <p class="first">
      A new program comes - JavaScript! Before, we talked much about Ruby, now let's see the difference between Ruby and JavaScript. Today I want to talk about the difference for looing.
    </p>
    <h2>Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript</h2>
    <p class="second">
       Actually, the main idea for the looping in Ruby and JavaScript are the same. However, there's are some differences that we need to pay attention. When I am always using Ruby and learn JavaScript, I always make mistakes because of the differences between Ruby and JavaScript. Now let's see the detailed differences for looping. 
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      1. We only use while loop in Ruby but we use while and for loop in JavaScript. <br>
      For example, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t7.1.JPG" /> 
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      2. In Ruby, we will use while...end to create a loop, but in JavaScript, we use for(){} or while(){} to create a loop. <br>
      For example, I want to output the sum of 1 to 5.<br>
      In Ruby: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t7.2.JPG" /> <br>
      In JavaScript: while loop - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t7.3.JPG" /> <br>
                     for loop - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiyao/chenxiyao.github.io/master/imags/t7.4.JPG" /> <br>
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      3. Inside of the loop, the basic statement differece (I mean not only for looping, but also everywhere): Ruby has no simicolon but JavaScript needs simicolon at the end of each line. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      Today, we talked about one part of the difference between Ruby and JavaScript - looping. I hope it's clear for you now!
