    <p class="first">
      My favourite fruit is <span class="bond">apple</span>. Apple is very sweet and healthy.
    </p>
    <p class="second">
        Another fruit I like is <span class="bond">banana</span>. Actually banana has much energy. I am fraid to gain weight because of eating banana, but it's true that banana is very delicous.
    </p>
    <p class="third">
        I also like <span class="bond">cherry</span> very much. In one year, only in some months, I can find cherry to buy, so I will buy cherry every week when I can see it.
    </p>

      <!-- copy and paste as many sections as you want to add paragraphs -->
    <p class="fourth">
      Blueberry, craberry, and some other <span class="bond">"berry"</span> fruit is also very good and very healthy. I know them after I came to the United States some years ago. They are awesome.
