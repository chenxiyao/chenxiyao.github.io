      Today, let's think about conflict. And let's talk about the problems.<br>
      1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?<br>
      2. What was the source of the conflict?<br>
      3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?<br>
      4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?<br>
      5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<br>
      6. What did you learn from this experience?

       I remember when I was freshman and lived in the dorm. My roommate nearly created a party once a week, and the party will last very late - even the morning of the next day - on Saturday or Sunday. I felt upset and angry because I cannot study the whole night and even cannot sleep well. I beared several weeks because I didn't want to trouble others. I understand it's the life of her.

    <p class="third">
      However, after several weeks, I found it really hurt my life. And I felt really angry because I respected her lifestyle, but she didn't respect mine. During this week, I let her know I feel uncomfortable because of her so long party.
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      Then, I talked with her what I am feeling and how her long party troubled me. I also gave her some suggestions like having the party in some friends' home who live alone. Or finish the party earlier at least before 11:00pm.
    <p class="fifth">
      After that, she understood clearly and she reduce the times of the party and finish them earlier. From this experience, I found that when we meet conflict, we need to try to solve it. It's not really hard like what we think at the first!
