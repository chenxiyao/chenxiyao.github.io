  <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>

    <p class="first">
      I sometimes can fell stereotype threat, and it affacted my achievement. I believe everyone will meet stereotype threat in his life, and it sometimes didn't do a big deal, but sometimes affact achievements much.
    </p>
    <p class="second">
       I feel stereotype threat when I work with people who speak very fast. <br>
       For example, I am always silent when I talk with someone who speaks very fast. I feel I cannot catch him and cannot follow his topic well. However, actaully, I express myself worth than what I should be.
    </p>

    <p class="second">
      Another time is when I did a project in campus. The professor spoke very fast, and then I feel hard to say anything. Then I did the project worth than I should do.

    <p class="fourth">
      Stereotype threat is always affacting us with our feeling. Even sometimes, we didn't realize it. I believe increase confidence or self-affirmation is important and necessary for reduce stereotype threat. 
    </p>
    <p class="first">
      In DBC learning, it's really possible to meet stereotype threat. Therefore, I hope all of us can encourage ourselves self-affirmation to reduce stereotype threat so that we can performance like we shoule do.
