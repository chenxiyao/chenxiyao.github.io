  <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>

    <p class="first">
      Last week you talked about Stereotype Threat. One of the antidotes identified by Claude M. Steele in his book is affirmation. Therefore, today, let's talk about values that are important to us. 
    </p>
    <p class="second">
       First of all, we know there's are many values like Achievement, Affection, Challenge, Community, Competition, Control, Courage and so on. Maybe most of them affact us sometimes, but let's talk one today that affected me a lot and are important for my life. <br>
    </p>

    <p class="second">
      The value that I want to talk today is Affection. Affection is very important  for me and affect me a lot. Before I do everything, I will think if I like it, and if I like it, I will have more power to do this, and will feel really happy to complete it. Therefore, I need to say that Affection is the value that is very important for me.  
    </p>
    <p class="fourth">
      Just like what I said last week, in DBC learning, it's really possible to meet stereotype threat. Therefore, we need some methods to combat Stereotype Threat at Dev Bootcamp. I believe our values will work very heavily at this moment. If I meet some very smart students and feel myself not good at coding, I will feel bad and express and work worse than I should do. However, Affection and Challenge will affect me to do better. I like this and the problem is a challenge and even a chance! Then I think I can work better and at least not so bad because of Stereotype threat.
    <p class="first">
      And when we feel down, I think we can eat some delicious or do some sports. I believe this will also help us feel better.
